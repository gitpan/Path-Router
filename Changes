    * Path::Router::Shell
      - fixed spelling of Term::ReadLine (RT #37693)

0.02 Mon. July 14, 2008
    * Path::Router
      - changed DEBUG from a constant sub to $DEBUG
        a package variable. This is a new module and 
        so easy debugability is important.
        
    * Path::Router::Route
      - silly fix to make sure exact paths will match
        - added tests for this
